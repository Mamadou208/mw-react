# Muiswerk React Tutorial #

## Introduction ##

Tutorial React, Redux and Routing for Muiswerk. Each step folder contains a file with instructions. 

## Installation ##

To work out your own solution I suggest creating your own branch. 

To get this project up and running you will need a couple of node modules:
 * react 
 * prop-types 
 * react-dom 
 * react-redux 
 * react-router-dom 
 * history
 * react-scripts 
 * redux 
 * redux-logger
 * redux-thunk

These modules are all defined in the package.json file. And will all be downloaded and installed by running  `npm install` without arguments, instead of: `$ npm install --save <module_name>`

## Syntax & Highlighting ##

This project uses Tabs instead of spaces. It is advised to use Tab Size 2. Also JSX requires some extra syntacic sugar. Babel provides plugins for both Sublime and Jetbrains (PhpStorm/Webstorm) enviroments.
