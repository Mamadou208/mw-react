1. Get up and running:
  For this project we will need a couple of node modules:
    react
    prop-types
    react-bootstrap
    react-dom
    react-redux
    react-router-dom
    history
    react-scripts
    redux
    redux-logger
    redux-thunk

  These modules are all defined in the package.json file. And will all be downloaded and installed by running npm install (instead of: npm install --save <module_name>). 

  The server can then be started by running: npm start.
