# 1.1 Components
	In 'index.js' in the src folder .. the App component from App.js imported an appended to the root element of the page. This is defined in '/mw-react/public/index.html'

	Keep in mind that elements returned should always be single elements, e.g.
	return ( 	// Does NOT compile
		<p>MyClass Instance</p>
		<p>MyClass Instance</p>
	)

	return ( 	// Does compile
		<div>
			<p>MyClass Instance</p>
			<p>MyClass Instance</p>
		</div>
	)

functions, such as willmount, constructor.. render
splitting files means that if a component in another file is NOT rendered that file is not loaded into the browser. 


# 1.2 Props & State
	Add something to app js. 

	State
	Heel json opject presenteren 

	add / remove persons

1.3 the idea is to split the visible page in components that work seperately.
